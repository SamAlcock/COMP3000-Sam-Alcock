# COMP3000 Sam Alcock
## RL Search Competition
### Project Supervisor: Dr Lauren Ansell

This project is for GCSE and A-Level students who are interested in learning about Computer Science and reinforcement learning. The RL Search Competition is an educational tool that will be able to determine the best algorithm for search and navigation tasks. The project will also be educating students in an interactive and visual way about different Reinforcement Learning algorithms, whilst aiming to keep it engaging and interesting. This unique take on educating students will hopefully create more interest in the field of Artificial Intelligence as a whole.
