# COMP3000 Sam Alcock
## AI Search Competition
### Project Supervisor: Dr Lauren Ansell

This project is for GCSE and A-Level students who are currently learning or interested in Computer Science and Reinforcement Learning. The AI Search Competition is an educational tool that will be able to compare strengths and weaknesses of different AI algorithms for search and navigation tasks. The project will also be educating students in an interactive and visual way about different AI algorithms, whilst aiming to keep it engaging and interesting. This unique way of educating will hopefully create more interest in the field of Artificial Intelligence as a whole and show students a practical application of theory that they may have already learnt.
